text1: I used to be a PhD student—you know, one of those poor souls who thought spending five years reading papers no one reads was a flex. Then I had a moment of clarity (or maybe just a mental breakdown) and dropped out faster than my advisor could say “publish or perish.”
text2: Naturally, I transitioned to the glamorous world of undocumented labor. I’ve worked in restaurants where the grease had more rights than I did, and in warehouses where “safety regulations” meant “don’t die in front of the manager.” I became a master of stealth dishwashing and forklift dodging—basically the Batman of minimum wage.
text3: Now I do a bit of coding, a bit of life-questioning, and a lot of explaining to my mom that no, I’m not going back to school, and yes, I’m still alive. Technically.
